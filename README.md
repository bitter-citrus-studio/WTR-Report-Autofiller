### Why I made the extensions 
When I make yellow card reports, I always feel for certain law reasons I make the same report over and over again. This extension semi automates the process, saving time 

### How it works?
The idea behind this is to make something that resembles a password manager for a form. The extension should:
- Detect the 2 teams from the WTR form.
- The user can input the relevant information
- A few of the form options now have a drop down of well used phrases
- The report box will create a sample report based on the team, number and law. 
- When the form is finished on the popup window, the fill form button is clicked and this will populate the report form on the webpage.

The report and other options can then be changed on the webpage, if required.
